# Reinforcement-Learning
Repository for projects from Reinforcement Learning laboratory.

This repository consists of projects from course <i> Reinforcement Learning </i> which took place at University of Economy Master's Degree in Katowice field of study: Informatics.

Class instructor: <i> dr inż. Przemysław Sekuła</i>.

Projects were based on code from class instructor: [https://github.com/PrzemekSekula/ReinfocementLearningClasses](https://github.com/PrzemekSekula/ReinfocementLearningClasses) and on <i> Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by R. S Sutton and A. G. Barto book </i>.

Has 5 project.
  1. K Arm Bandit.
  2. Dynamic Programming.
  3. Monte Carlo.
  4. QLearning.
  5. Linear Regression.
     
Comments in a code and variables can be written in Polish Language.



## Dynamic Programming

Create a code that uses one of DP algorithms to find an optimal policy for the given world. To pass the assignment you have to:

- show that your code works
- understand the code
- understand the theory behind the code
- understand the general idea of dynamic programming.  

<i> Note 1: It is not necessary to use the simulator, but you should at least consider it. It will make your life much easier. </i>  
<i> Note 2: You may use any discount rate you wish, but I recommend you to discount your rewards (use something < 1, eg. 0.9) </i>
