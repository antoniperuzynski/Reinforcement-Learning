## Dynamic Programming

Create a code that uses one of DP algorithms to find an optimal policy for the given world. To pass the assignment you have to:

- show that your code works
- understand the code
- understand the theory behind the code
- understand the general idea of dynamic programming.  


<i> Note 1: It is not necessary to use the simulator, but you should at least consider it. It will make your life much easier. </i>  
<i> Note 2: You may use any discount rate you wish, but I recommend you to discount your rewards (use something < 1, eg. 0.9) </i>
